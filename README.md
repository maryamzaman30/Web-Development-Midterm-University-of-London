## Web Development - Team Project

## Mar 2023 - Jul 2023

## Associated with University of London

This project was part of our Midterm. We were tasked with a team project in web development, where we had to create a three-page website themed around theme parks. Our team comprised four members (one from Faisalabad and three from Islamabad), so communication and understanding were crucial. We communicated through the Slack group provided by the University of London. The project required extensive research, meticulous planning, effective coordination, and clear communication among team members. Before diving into coding, we designed wireframes for the website. The final website was developed using HTML and CSS.

Note: Code written between Start and End in PDF file is my own. Any other code or resources used are referenced.
